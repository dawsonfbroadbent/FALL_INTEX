                Our Ballet Folklórico program fosters joy, confidence, and creative self-expression
                through the vibrant traditions of Latin American folk dance. Dancers learn choreography
                inspired by regional styles, colorful costumes, and storytelling that honors their
                families' roots and the communities they come from.
            </p>

            <p>
                As participants move through steps and music passed down across generations, they deepen
                their connection to culture and identity. Classes emphasize posture, musicality, teamwork,
                and performance skills that help young women feel proud to represent their heritage on stage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond the stage, dancers build discipline, resilience, and leadership skills. They learn
                to set goals, support their peers, and take healthy risks in a safe, encouraging environment—
                all while celebrating who they are and where they come from.

            <p>
                We love mariachi music—so much that we created an all-female Ella Rises mariachi band!
                Our mariachi program, relaunched in spring 2025, welcomes all levels of musical
                experience—from brand new beginners to more advanced musicians.
            </p>

            <p>
                Students learn traditional mariachi repertoire, rhythms, and performance practices
                that celebrate the heart of Mexican and Latin American culture. As they rehearse together,
                participants grow in musical skill, stage presence, and confidence in their own voices.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ensemble experience teaches teamwork, listening, and leadership. Young women learn
                what it means to carry forward a rich musical tradition while seeing themselves reflected
                in a powerful, female-led mariachi group. Performances become moments of pride for
                participants, their families, and the community.
            </p>

            <p class="er-program-callout">
                Our mariachi program is more than music—it's a space to belong, to be heard, and to proudly say,

            <p>
                Our STEAM program offers virtual and in-person workshops that develop curiosity,
                creativity, and critical thinking. Sessions invite participants to explore science,
                technology, engineering, art, and math in ways that feel relevant to their lived
                experiences and future goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through hands-on projects, demos, and interactive discussions, participants are guided
                to ask questions, test ideas, and see how STEAM careers can make a real impact in their
                communities. Workshops highlight Latine role models and culturally aware examples so
                girls can picture themselves as future engineers, artists, scientists, and innovators.

            <p>
                By connecting technical skills with cultural pride and creativity, our STEAM program
                helps young women see that they don't have to choose between identity and opportunity—
                both can grow together.

                The Ella Rises Summit is a day camp packed with activities that offer a glimpse into
                the full Ella Rises experience: hands-on art, engaging STEM activities, and a strong
                focus on education and future pathways.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout the day, participants rotate through sessions that highlight how creativity,
                culture, and academics can work together. They might paint, experiment in a STEM lab,
                hear from guest speakers, or participate in small-group discussions about their dreams
                and goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                We conclude the day camp with a tour of a local university or technical college, giving
                participants the chance to walk campus paths, see classrooms and labs, and start to
                imagine themselves as future college students. These experiences help demystify higher
                education and make the idea of college feel more tangible and attainable.
