Ella Rises (Nonprofit) — What They Do

Ella Rises is a nonprofit organization focused on empowering young women (ages 11–18) to pursue higher education while also embracing and celebrating their cultural heritage.

Their overall approach blends:
	•	Identity + culture (heritage-based arts programs)
	•	Confidence + leadership (community, performance, mentorship-style experiences)
	•	Education + pathways (exposure to college/technical school options and future careers)
	•	Skills + exploration (music, dance, and STEAM workshops that build discipline and curiosity)

They report that their signature programs and the Ella Rises Summit serve 150+ young women each year.
